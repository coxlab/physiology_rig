1 : utter crap, do not use
2 : still crap (but not as dangerous)
3 : still crap but better than 2, movement does not seem to stop on following error
4 : things are looking a little better, I think several things are wired backwards
5 : flipped the dac output, everything seems to be working fine now :)
6 : functional
7 : testing higher speeds (following error at more negative than current position)
8 : all working except pid tuning, full range of motion possible and homing useing positive limit switch

with the newport stage, acceleration is twice the velocity, jerk is < (~0.5 accel)

9 : used pid settings and some trajectory settings from newport stage, no more following errors
be sure to run the steps with Indexed and not Free Run (free run = following error)
10 : using old (thor tuned pid settings) with eased off trajectory settings and indexed move

10 is good to go (don't go faster than 0.1 or at most 0.2mm/s)
